# enhanced-all-settled

A better implementation of JS internal `Promise.allSettled`

# Usage

TODO

# Features

- More consistent types that you can actually import in your code (for typescript users)

- Explicit returns of inputs corresponding to rejected / successful executions

# Roadmap

Add options for :

- Setting a timeout

- A second function to use if you're only interested in successful promises' output
